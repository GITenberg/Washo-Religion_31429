<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This paper is the result of two and one-half months' field work among the Washo
Indians of California and Nevada supported by the Department of Anthropology of the
University of California and the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. In it I have tried to
describe the religious beliefs and ritual activities of the Washo as they can be examined
today. Where possible I have attempted to reconstruct the aboriginal patterns
and trace the course of change between these two points in time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A second purpose has been to supplement the culture element distribution lists
prepared by Omer C. Stewart in 1936 (Stewart 1941). In a number of instances his
findings were at variance with those of Smith, whose notes Stewart incorporated; I
have been able to resolve some of the differences between Stewart and Smith. Where
my own research has led me to disagree with the statements in the culture element
distributions I have discussed the problem. In general my own work simply expands
the rather sparse descriptions of the element lists (Stewart 1941, pp. 366-418). The
culture element distribution list numbers which refer to traits dealt with in the various
sections are indicated in parentheses following the headings. Where a trait or
complex is dealt with in detail it is indicated by parentheses in the text. Statements
not otherwise attributed are the result of my own field work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am indebted to Mr. W. L. d'Azevedo, who encouraged me to carry on field work
among the Washo and who has made his own field notes and knowledge available to
me. I have indicated information attributable to d'Azevedo by placing his name in
parentheses in the text; where his name appears with a date, the reference is to
a work published by him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I also wish to express my thanks for the suggestions made by J. H. Rowe, R. F.
Millon, and D. M. Schneider, who read this article before it went to press, and to
acknowledge the final reading given the manuscript by the late A. L. Kroeber.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition, my thanks are owed to Mr. Frank Yapparagari, Mrs. Juanita Schubert,
and Mrs. Lois Buck of Gardnerville and Minden, Nevada, to Mr. Richard Shulter of
the Nevada State Museum in Carson City, Nevada, and to Mrs. E. M. Keenan of
Paradise, California, who assisted in various ways in the progress of the investigation.
Last, to the various members of the Washo tribe, who with patience and good
humor bore the probing into their lives, my deepest gratitude.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This paper will devote itself to a description of the
religious life of the Washo Indians living in the communities
of Sierraville, Loyalton, and Woodfords, in
California, and Reno, Carson City, and Dresslerville,
Nevada. Smaller numbers are scattered throughout the
area which was their aboriginal range, roughly from
the southern end of Honey Lake to Antelope Valley and
from the divide of the Pinenut Range in Nevada, almost
to Placerville, California.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A short ethnography by Barrett dealing in large part
with material culture, Lowie's Ethnographic Notes, and
Stewart's Element Lists constitute almost the only general
references on Washo culture. Various other writers
have dealt with specialized questions such as linguistics
(Kroeber, Jacobson), peyotism (Siskin, d'Azevedo),
and music (Merriam).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of the statements about the Washo give the impression
that they have long been on the edge of oblivion
(Mooney, Kroeber, etc.), and population estimates
have been well under one thousand for the past fifty
years. However, I find myself in agreement with d'Azevedo<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
that the Washo are a vigorous and continuing cultural
entity. My own rather impressionistic estimate
of population is that there are perhaps two thousand
Indians in the area who consider themselves as Washo
and form a part of a viable cultural unit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My own field work was devoted to an attempt to
trace the patterns of change among these people since
the entrance of the white man into their area. To this
end I spent a great deal of time with older informants,
but my work was not exclusively <span class="tei tei-q">“salvage ethnography.”</span>
Many aspects of Washo culture have changed dramatically
in the past century; this is particularly true in
the area of material culture and subsistence activities.
On the other hand, I was impressed by the tenacity of
the less material aspects of the culture. The always-difficult-to-define
world view or ethos of the Washo,
which so clearly separates them from other cultures,
is very much an entity expressed in the attitudes and
actions of the Washo Indians, whether they are oldsters
who can remember many aspects of the <span class="tei tei-q">“old
days”</span> or children who have not yet entered the newly
integrated schools of Nevada. This continuity seems
most clearly expressed in the area which we subsume
under the title <span class="tei tei-q">“Religion.”</span> Almost all Washo, even the
youngsters, are familiar with, or at least aware of,
Washo mythology, attitudes about ghosts, spirits, medicine,
and a number of ritual actions and beliefs which
are common elements in Washo life today.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is not to imply that Washo religious activity
has not been affected by the tremendous changes which
have taken place in western Nevada and eastern California.
I suggest that rather than disappearing under
the withering rationalism of civilization the religion
of the Washo has simply altered and expanded to serve
the Washo in new situations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this work I take the broadest possible definition
of religion, conceiving it as any institutionalized activity
or attitude which reflects the Washo view of the
cosmos. In so doing I have included a number of categories
which may not generally be considered suitable
for inclusion under the heading of religion. Stewart,
for instance, includes shamanism, curing, special powers
of shamans, miscellaneous shamanistic information,
guardian spirits, destiny of the soul, ghosts or
soul, and jimsonweed. My own work includes some of
these specifically, incorporates some under other headings,
and treats a number of subjects not included in
the list given above.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reason for this approach is practical rather
than theoretical or philosophical. As anthropological
definitions of religions are extremely varied and the
activities described as religious under various definitions
cover a greater or narrower range, it seems
valuable to include as many activities as possible in
a purely descriptive work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The goal of this paper is to make as much information
as possible about the religious and ritual activities
of the Washo available to scholars who may be
interested in religion. The inclusion of as many fields
of activity as possible permits them to select information
which they feel pertinent to their interests.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherever possible I have tried to include direct
quotations from informants as well as information
about their behavior and attitudes, so that my own
interpretations and conclusions can be examined by
others in light of the information on which they are
based.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Statements made by informants are indicated by
quotation marks. I did not have a recording device
available and did not attempt to record entire interviews
verbatim. However, whenever informants indicated
that they considered their statements important
I took them down word for word. If I felt some passing
remark to have significance, I asked the informant
to repeat it and often read it back to him for verification.
Other stories, particularly those of a mythological
nature, or semilegends, or experiences which
were important to individual informants, were repeated
voluntarily on almost every occasion of our meeting.
Whenever statements are presented in quotation marks
the material was gathered in this manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This paper contains material from a number of
sources. Statements of fact or interpretations taken
from published anthropological or historic works are
indicated by citations in the customary manner. Information
based on conversations or other private communications
with other investigators is so designated.
All statements of fact which are not credited to these
two sources are taken from my own field notes and
represent statements of my informants.

<h1 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 3.46em; margin-top: 3.46em"><span style="font-size: 173%">Mythology</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Washo mythology has been presented in the form
of interlinear texts by Dangberg (1927) and in Lowie's
Ethnographic Notes (1939, pp. 333-351). There are two
versions of the creation myth, one describing the creation
of Paiute, Washo, and Diggers from the seeds of
the cattail by the Creator Woman, and the second attributing
the creation of Indians to the Creation Man,
who formed the three groups from among his sons to
keep them from quarreling. Lowie also reports the
common theme of several previous inhabitations of
the earth. The most important myth, or at least the
one which is still commonly told and seems to be the
favorite among the Washo, devotes itself to the adventures
of Damalali (short-tailed weasel) and Pewetseli
(long-tailed weasel). These heroes are responsible for
many of the natural features of the region so references
to this myth are rather frequent. The Coyote,
in the form of a rather malevolent and stupid trickster,
and the Wolf, a generally patriarchal and protective
figure, appear in several myths, as do cannibalistic
giants and a giant bird, the an.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Figures which appear only incidentally in the myths
as recounted are elaborated almost infinitely in what
might best be termed folk fantasy.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">Water Babies</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most prominent of these figures are the Water
Babies (Stewart 1941, p. 444, 2574). In the mythology,
Water Baby figures as the creature responsible for
the many lakes of the eastern Sierra. Killed and
scalped by the rascally Damalali, Water Baby commands
the waters of the area to rise until the weasel
returns the scalp to avoid drowning. The waters left
in mountain valleys as the flood receded formed the
lakes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Water Baby is not confined to mythology. My
informants were able to describe the appearance of a
Water Baby in detail, to supply me with population
figures, and to recount an almost endless series of
incidents in which Water Babies were involved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All informants agreed that the Water Baby is a
creature about one and one-half feet tall, gray in
color, with extremely long black hair which never
touches the ground but which floats along behind the
Water Babies when they walk. In general, these creatures
look like small humans. However, they are
boneless, cold to the touch, and damp.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Between two and three thousand Water Babies live
in the Sierra, according to one informant. They inhabit
lakes, streams, marshes, ponds, springs, and irrigation
ditches. They speak a language of their own but
are always able to speak Washo. With a single exception,
every Washo of middle age and over to whom I
talked claimed to have at least heard Water Babies
calling from some body of water in the night. Several
others claimed to have seen Water Baby footprints
(one even reporting that the footprints he had seen
were those of a female because the tracks were clearly
those of high heeled shoes!). One informant steadfastly
claimed to have seen a Water Baby, at least
fleetingly, in 1956.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two distinct attitudes about these creatures are displayed
by the Washo. Most informants openly admitted
being afraid of Water Babies. If they heard one they
remained in their houses or attempted to avoid contact.
They claimed that if a person saw a Water Baby by
accident, at the very least he would be struck unconscious
and greater harm, in the form of sickness,
might be inflicted on him or on one of his relatives.
The general attitude was that Water Babies were best
left alone because they were extremely powerful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This attitude is perhaps summed up best by one of
my informants, a rather sophisticated Washo who has
lived in cities for long periods and who is an active
leader in the tribe's legal battle with the federal government.
He is also a devoted peyotist who often conducts
curing ceremonies and is conceded to have a
curing power. He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If they ever get up a bunch
to trap one of them [Water Babies], I don't want to
have nothing to do with it.”</span> When I asked why not, he
replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“Why hell, if you make one of them things
mad they'll flood the world. I just don't want nothing
to do with them. I ain't that desperate.”</span> I asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“desperate
for what?”</span> and he replied <span class="tei tei-q">“for power. I like
to dream about womens [sic] and things like that, not
about Water Babies and that funny stuff.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This last statement clearly indicates the other attitude
about Water Babies; they are often guardian spirits
of Washo who have special power, particularly shamanistic
curing power. Another informant expressed
this other attitude about these creatures. He is about
seventy, attended Stewart Indian School for ten years
and lived among the Hopi for ten years. He boasts a
stone and cement-block home, the only such dwelling
owned by a Washo. He has learned to bead baskets
and during most of the year earns a reasonable income
from this. His seeming adjustment to white culture
is confounded when his philosophic position is examined.
He can only be termed a mystic who interprets
the world in Indian terms. Exposure to such influences
as the writings of Kroeber and Huxley has
only confirmed his essentially Indian viewpoint. Both
his parents were famous Indian doctors and his maternal
uncle, who was also his mentor,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
was a famous
shaman. My informant implied that his uncle's spirit
(wegeleyo), from which his power was derived, was
the Water Baby, and his own carefully guarded statement
implied that the creature was potentially his own
spirit. His view of the Water Baby was quite the reverse
of other informants. <span class="tei tei-q">“Some people think the
Water Baby will hurt them, but he won't. If they see
him by accident he won't do nothing. But if he has
given you his power and you see him—then wham, he
maybe knock you right down.”</span> This appears to have
been his way of describing a seizure by the Water
Baby, which although a fearful experience, usually resulted
in the gift of additional power. There was, however,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
general agreement among informants that the
Water Baby could, if he gave his power to a person,
demand repayment with the lives of his protégé's
close relatives or entire family.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The various powers and activities of the Water
Babies are perhaps best described in the following
stories recounted by informants:
</p>

basket to the Water Babies at Lake </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Išmedel</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. There
is an island in this lake and my Dad was supposed
to go out to that island and leave a basket. I was
too young then but he took my brother. They went
up there and my Dad just started walking out to
the lake and the water never got any deeper than
there (pointing to his knees). He walked right on
that water. He left that basket and came back and
he got well. Them Water Babies helped him walk
on the water. My brother saw it happen.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

There is a kind of black sucker live there but no
Indians ever caught them because that was a Water
Baby place and they was Water Baby food. Womens
used to sit on a platform of logs and weave baskets
there [special baskets for the Water Babies,
apparently, such as the one used as offering in the
story above]. One time I took another fella like
you [anthropologist] up there but when we got there
we couldn't find nothing but sand with a little water
bubbling up in the middle. He wouldn't believe me.
I showed him where them womens had sat but I
think he thought I was lying. I guess them Water
Babies did something.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

this house about two years ago. I was in bed in
that room there and I felt these little hands creeping
under the covers. I brushed 'em away but they
just come back. They tried to feel me down here
[indicating his genitalia]. I yelled for my mother
and she come in and said something and something
went zip (waving arm violently to indicate direction)
right out of that window. We looked out that way
[to the south], that's toward Walker Lake. Everything
was kind of hazy blue.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In light of Washo views about receiving shamanistic
power, it would appear that my informant was suggesting
that this visitation was a Water Baby making its
patronage known.

felt like he wanted a bath. Them Water Babies must
have been working on him. He went over by the
creek and started to lean over and then he passed
out and fell into the water and there was a Water
Baby. That Water Baby said, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">come on,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> and he took
him down to Water Baby country. The chief of the
Water Babies lived in a big house made out of that
black shining rock [obsidian]. But they didn't go
there. The Water Baby said </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">we got some girls that
want to give you something,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> and he took my uncle
to a place and there was five girls there. They all
sat around my uncle and sang him a song and told
him that it was his song from now on. Then the
Water Baby took my uncle back and then he said
it was like waking up from a dream and there he
was laying in the creek down under a bunch of cattails.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>

went all the way down there to tell the mayor that
they had better let that Water Baby loose, but nobody
would pay no attention to him. Well you know
they had a big earthquake down there and the water
came up around everything. When it was all over
that tank where they had the Water Baby was empty.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Washo mythology features several creatures which
may each have contributed to the wild men I will describe
in this section. Both Lowie and Dangberg report
myths in which a giant, Hangawuiwui, is the principal
figure. Although the myths do not describe him,
my informants generally picture him as a colossus
who hops on a single leg from the top of one mountain
to another. He has a single eye to match his
single limb and a proclivity for gobbling up Indians.
Several miles southwest of Gardnerville, in the hills
overlooking Double Spring Flats, a cave is known by
the Washo as Hangawuiwui aɲ¿l (the place where
Hangawuiwui lives). Present-day Indians tell a number
of stories about this giant and display a certain
uneasiness when they are near places he is supposed
to haunt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another kind of giant appears in a myth reported
by Lowie. These beings appear to be considerably
more human than Hangawuiwui. Traditionally they
camped south of Pyramid Lake and terrorized the
Paiutes. However, when one of their number attempted
to take fish from a Washo the tribe rallied and routed
the giants in a battle near Walker Lake. The giants
did not have bows and arrows. They fortified themselves
behind rock walls and threw stones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to my informant on the subject, the mountains
are still the home of a tribe of <span class="tei tei-q">“wild men.”</span> These
people have managed to hide the location of their camps
so that no one knows where they live. My informant
felt that they were in fact some kind of Indian. Despite
the mythological ability of the Washo to defeat
the giants, modern stories about them suggest they
have a great deal of supernatural power in addition
to their physical prowess.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following stories were told to me as contemporary
or relatively recent occurrences:
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
1. </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">There is these wild fellas up in the mountains.
I guess you call them giants. One time there
was an old man who had set up a blind to hunt chipmunks,
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
like I told you yesterday. He was up in the
pine-nut hills and he had killed four chipmunks.
One of these fellas come along and he snatched up
a chipmunk and he ate it. Then he snatched another
and ate it. He tried to grab another but the old
man wrestled with him and stopped him from getting
the chipmunk and then he got away. He tussled
with that wild man and got away. But a long time
after when he was real old and went around with a
long stick [staff], he went out walking and he didn't
come back. They went out looking for him and found
his tracks leading up the foot of Job's Peak and
they ended there. His stick was stuck in the ground
and at the end of his tracks it looked like something
had snatched him up.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I asked if the wild men had gotten him my
informant said he thought so. The theme of a wild
man's attempting to take part of a catch from a Washo
recalls the myth as reported by Lowie, although in the
version he recorded the incident occurred between
Wadsworth and Sparks and the final battle took place
at Walker Lake, whereas my informant changed the
locale to the Carson Valley area.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
2. </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">My old grandfather had this happen to him.
He was hunting up by the Lake [Tahoe], In them
days hunters just carried little thin rabbit skin
blankets. They covered up their front and put their
back to the fire. My old grandfather was just laying
there when he noticed the fire going down (maybe
that wild man did something to the fire). Pretty
soon he saw a big shadow. He was pretty scared
and just laid there. Pretty soon he felt a hand feeling
his feet and in between his toes and up his leg
and all around his hole [anus]. Pretty soon it reached
his face and tried to put his finger in my grandfather's
mouth. My grandfather bit that finger real
hard and the wild man yelled and ran away.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I asked if the wild men still existed and my informant
replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sure. They are up there in the mountains.
They are pretty smart and you can't see them. But us
Washo can hear them talking. We can understand their
language. I have thought a lot about it and they should
have called some Washo over to Oroville when they
caught that fella over there. I read about it in the
newspaper when I was younger. I know they had a lot
of them California Indians come up there but they
couldn't understand him. I'll bet a Washo could have
understood him.”</span> I asked if he thought it had been a
wild man and he nodded in affirmation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“wild man”</span> of course was the now-famous Ishi,
the last of the Southern Yana who wandered half starved
into a slaughterhouse in Oroville in 1911.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Washo myths contain a number of tales about a
bumbling, not very bright, generally malevolent Coyote,
who as a companion of Wolf seems to devote a great deal
of time to eating Indians and to sexual misadventures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Modern Washo seem less willing than their forebears
to weave Coyote into tales but are no less conscious
of his malevolent presence. Peyotists often see
visions or dream of Coyote (d'Azevedo and Merriam
1957), and quick asides about Coyote's influence are
apt to come up in conversation either as tentative
jokes or in seriousness. One tale of a modern occurrence
involving Coyote did come my way through the
kindness of Warren d'Azevedo. His informant was the
brother-in-law of my own informant and, like his kinsman,
a semimystic, very conscious of his Indianness
and credited by other Washo with powers beyond those
of an ordinary man in hunting.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

owned it. One night he didn't come home but I
kept hearing something walking around that shack.
The next morning when that guy came home he
was all tired out and there was Coyote tracks all
around that shack. I got my gun and told that guy
to stay away from me</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> (d'Azevedo).
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Aɲ, a huge man-eating bird described in Lowie's
myth number 13, is no longer alive, but according
to several informants the creature's bones or at
least the island on which it nested can be seen by
people flying over the lake because they are only a
bit below the surface. Washo insist that white airplane
pilots see the shape of the island daily but keep silent
because they don't want to confirm an Indian story.
One day on a trip around Lake Tahoe my Indian
companion, a sometime leader among the Washo
asked: <span class="tei tei-q">“If we get that money from our claim do
you think one of them archeologist fellas could
go down under the water and find that there aɲ
bird's skeleton?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The foregoing paragraphs illustrate the tenacity
with which Washo mythology has maintained itself
among these people. The entirety of many of the
myths is no longer part of the repertoire of every
adult Washo, but variations, on-the-spot reconstructions,
and the introduction of mythological themes into
contemporary stories of a secular nature are definitely
part of the oral literature of the Washo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is interesting to note that some aspects of Washo
mythology appear to have more viability than others.
Thus the Water Baby remains an important and vital
aspect of modern Washo life, as does the Coyote. The
twin weasels have lost much of their appeal, as has
the giant Hangawuiwui. The giants of the mountains
are acknowledged to be alive today but are seldom referred
to, whereas Coyote and Water Baby are almost
always mentioned and spoken of as living entities even
by the most progressive Washo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Except for the making of offerings to nature, which
may be defined as purely religious, other religious or
ritual activities dealing with what we would call the
supernatural are so integrated with other aspects of
Washo life as to be almost inseparable. Thus in describing
the religious activities of the Washo I will
proceed through various phases of their life, pointing
out the ritual actions which are part of Washo behavior
in specific situations.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Washo word da¿man¿li¿ has a wide range of
meanings which include almost all people with supernatural
powers, including curers of several orders.
The terms which they use when discussing the subject
in English are somewhat more precise and will
be used in this paper.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Washo make a distinction between curers
(2594-96) and Indian doctors. The latter, as will be
shown, are true shamans whereas the former are
somewhat less powerful. Curers appear to be women
who have certain powers revealed to them in dreams.
Such persons are usually members of what the Washo
describe as a <span class="tei tei-q">“doctor family.”</span> An informant described
the activities of such a curer:

Far more important than the curers, however, were
the Indian doctors. Such men were never exclusive
specialists and were apparently expected to share in
the work of hunting and fishing with less gifted men.
With the introduction of money by the whites, shamans
appear to have approached something like specialization,
charging fees of up to twenty dollars a session
for their services.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Until the middle 1930's there were a number of
shamans among the Washo (Stewart 1944). However,
with the introduction of the peyote cult, which among
the Washo is concerned with curing, the shaman was
superseded. Today only a single Washo practices shamanistic
curing. Interestingly enough this man, now
seventy-five, was an informant of Lowie's in the 1920's,
and at that time Lowie described him as a sophisticated
young Washo, somewhat mystic and with shamanistic
ambitions (Lowie 1939).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This man, Henry Rupert, spent ten years in the
Indian school at the Stewart Agency and after graduation
worked for a number of years in a printing plant
in Reno. When questioned about the old days he was
a fair informant, seldom offering more information
than was asked for and clearly enjoying the business
of making a white man work for every scrap of information.
He was also given to dropping subtle hints and
waiting with stolid indifference to see if I had been
alert. He did not deny his shamanistic practices but
was less than willing to discuss them in detail.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His equipment, he admitted (but refused to show me),
consisted of a butterfly-cocoon rattle, an eagle-bone
whistle, and a feather headband. <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't really do
nothing but help nature,”</span> he said. When I replied that
only some people know how to help nature he was
gratified and smiled. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh well, it's all psychological
anyway,”</span> he answered, confirming Lowie's description
of him as a sophisticate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He is noted for his rather atypical practice of tending
a garden, which consists mostly of fruit trees, and
for his open liking for old-fashioned foods, which he
collects, including fly grubs and locusts. I was not able
to observe his curing procedures, but they were described
to me by another informant, a seventy-five-year-old
woman, considered one of the most progressive
of the residents of Dresslerville.

Another informant, the man who was cured by his
mother—curiously another graduate of the Stewart
School and outwardly a progressive Indian—was a veritable
fountain of shamanistic knowledge. His father and
maternal uncle were both well-known shamans. Although
he insisted that he had no particular power himself,
other Indians generally claimed that he had certain
hunting medicines which assisted him in taking game.
There is little doubt that he believed he had been approached
by spirits offering him shamanistic power.
His life story was a long recital of ailments and mystic
occurrences. The ailments, coupled with his attitude
about spiritual power, suggested strongly that his suffering
had been due to a rejection of the power offered
(Whiting 1950). He supplied the following account about
the process of becoming a shaman.

Later it says for you to add more. Finally it

to doctor for four nights. Then he'd lay out all his
stuff and give it a drink by sprinkling water on it.
Then he'd shake his rattle and sing and touch the
patient with his hands. He'd talk to the sickness,
like he knew it ... like maybe he was friends to

that sickness come out and go into the doctor
so hard they can't get it out and have to get another
doctor to help him. Sometimes it hit them so hard
that they defecate. I seen them doctors just fill
their pants. If it's real tough they get all stiff and
fall over. Sometimes fall right in the fire and their
clothes all burn off but it don't burn them none. You
can't touch them then or it will kill them. But when
they begin to shake a little and that rattle begins to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This recital of the process of becoming a doctor
shows clearly the ideal situation, the receiving of
powers, unsought, from supernatural sources, the
guardian spirit watching over its protégé's career,
providing him with the wherewithal in the form of
songs, spells, and paraphernalia. In fact, however, it
would appear that the process of becoming a shaman
was far more a conscious and voluntary act on the
part of an individual than would be supposed from the
foregoing story.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Doctoring power clearly seems to have remained
within certain families. The informant who gave the
foregoing account was himself the son of a woman
curer and a famous doctor and the nephew of another
doctor. From his childhood he was familiar with the
procedures of curing, with stories about dreams, spirit
visitations, trips to the afterworld, mysterious and sacred
locations. He somewhat proudly admitted that as
a boy he <span class="tei tei-q">“used to shake that rattle”</span> himself. In short,
until his shamanistic education was interrupted by white
man's schooling, he was a shaman's apprentice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This view is supported by the statements of other
informants: <span class="tei tei-q">“Of course them people that is from a doctor
family, they have dreams and get curing power,”</span>
said one rather assimilated woman of about seventy-five.
Another informant, a man of sixty, who repeatedly
indicated his fear of <span class="tei tei-q">“power”</span> but at the same time
was reputed to be an important curer in the peyote
church said: <span class="tei tei-q">“If you come from a family of dreamers
there ain't nothing you can do. You're trapped by it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Young shamans appear to have undergone a period
of informal apprenticeship under an older doctor. Although
there appears to have been no special requirement
that a shaman have an assistant, it was not uncommon
for a younger man to help out. According to
one informant, when Blind Mike, one of the well-known
doctors in historic times, was becoming a doctor, his
teacher required him to smoke four hand-rolled cigarettes
in a row without allowing the smoke to escape
from his lungs. This was not considered an exercise
in legerdemain but a way to develop the younger man's
control over his power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Each doctor received instruction from his spirit
familiar as to what paraphernalia he should gather but
there was a great deal of uniformity in the outfits of
Washo doctors. The following description is of the kit
of my informant's uncle, who practiced until the first
decade of this century, and it includes some items
clearly postwhite in origin.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I don't know what all doctors had but I'll tell
you what my old uncle had 'cause I seen it lots of
times. [At this point another Indian entered the
house, obviously curious, and my informant stopped
talking until the visitor left.] He had eagle feathers
and magpie feathers. He had a rattle with six or
eight cocoons on a stick wrapped in weasel skin and
humming bird feathers. He had a tobacco pouch of
tree-squirrel hide. He also had a stone. It looked
like a big tooth with a cavity in it. He told me how
he got that stone. He was walking to town [Genoa,
Nevada] one day and he heard something whistle.
He kept on walking but it whistled again. So he went
looking for what was making that noise and he found
that stone setting by a fence post. I heard that stone
whistle sometimes when he was doctoring. He also
had a tie made out of beadwork. Lots of times a
doctor would pay some woman to make him a real
fine basket or some bead work because that's what
his power told him to do.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Washo doctors often worked together on <span class="tei tei-q">“tough”</span> cases.
One such was the treatment of what seems to have been
an infected elbow by my informant's uncle and Blind
Mike. The first step in the process was to blow smoke
in a circle around the painful area so that the sickness
couldn't move. This was followed by singing, rattling,
and sucking until something bright began to come out.
It was, according to witnesses, as bright as a star, so
bright in fact that even Blind Mike could see it. The
bright object proved to be (if we can trust descriptions)
the stone and setting of a cheap ring which was removed
from the sore arm. It is interesting to note that while
this process was successful my informant seemed to
consider the cure less than one-hundred-per-cent effective
because the woman who was being treated died two
years later.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Doctors were privy to a number of secrets which
were not common knowledge among most Washo. Such
a secret was the cave reputed to be inside Cave Rock
at Lake Tahoe. This cave was a retreat for shamans
who went there to commune with their spirits or to
secrete a particularly important piece of paraphernalia.
The cave could be entered through a narrow opening
on the landward side, but most shamans preferred a
more dramatic entrance. By standing on a certain rock
and singing a special song they were lowered through
the water and then lifted into the cave. The last doctor
to attempt this was Blind Mike. He was directed
to go to the cave in a dream. However, he permitted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his wife to accompany him and when she saw him begin
to sink into the water she screamed with fear.
The rock stopped sinking with Mike only knee deep in
the water. Since that time no one has attempted to
enter the room. This promontory is the center of
Water Baby habitation and is reported to be the upper
end of a tunnel which extends under the mountains to
Genoa so that Water Babies can move freely from the
lake to the valley. The rock also marks the eastern
end of a road of white sand reported to cross the
lake bottom. On the northwest end of the road was located
a bed of plants, probably wild parsnips, which
doctors gathered for medicine. The wild parsnip was
poisonous but doctors ate it to demonstrate their power.
They also chewed it into a paste and spread it on
rattlesnake bites.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another spot familiar to doctors was a mysterious
hole in the mountains near Blue Lake. The hole could
be located by following a spiraling path of white quartz
toward the center. According to the Washo tale, if a
man dropped even as much as a hair into this hole it
made a great roaring sound. Suzie Dick, a Washo woman,
whose claim of being one hundred years' old is
borne out by white residents, insists that as a fifteen-year-old
girl she went to see this hole and was terrorized
by a huge hand which reached up out of the darkness
and tried to seize her.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vaguely known to most Washo but familiar to doctors
was a cave situated south and west of Gardnerville
where ready-made grinding stones were to be
found. These, depending on the informant, were made
by old Indians or were put there by <span class="tei tei-q">“nature”</span> for the
use of the Washo.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indian doctors often used their power in spectacular
displays, apparently to impress patients. Often
these displays were competitive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the words of one informant: <span class="tei tei-q">“Them old doctors
used to see who had the most power. They'd stick four
or five sticks in the ground, each one farther away
than the last one, and see how many they could knock
down.”</span> Then, disconcertingly, he added: <span class="tei tei-q">“You can read
about that in Kroeber. He tells about some other Indians
who did that but I guess he didn't know the
Washo did it too.”</span> This informant considered Professor
Kroeber as an authority second only to himself
in matters pertaining to Indians.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were no doctors with rainmaking power among
the Washo. However, anyone, particularly a man deemed
to be a leader, might encourage rain during the summer.
The rite, which is still observed occasionally by
individuals, consists of soaking a pine-nut cone in water
and placing it on the ground in the pine-nut hills. Modern
Washo look upon this more as a prayer, but in the
past it may have been considered as a spell.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ancient matriarch Suzie Dick steadfastly insists
that less rain falls in the Carson Valley than in neighboring
valleys because <span class="tei tei-q">“nobody is talking to God anymore
around here.”</span> While she talked she pointed to the
clouds hanging over Washo and Antelope valleys and to
the cloudless sky overhead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Older white residents speak of Indian rainmakers,
which is a source of much amusement among the Washo.
Until a few years ago an Indian, who still lives in
Dresslerville, used to take advantage of the gullibility
or generosity of white ranchers by performing <span class="tei tei-q">“rain
dances”</span> on their property in return for handouts of
food. The Washo generally frowned on this, but because
white men were the victims of the fraud it was considered
harmless.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The father of the false rainmaker was a diviner of
stolen articles. His method was to sit and smoke until
the location of the desired article was revealed to him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eagle and magpie feathers were considered to be
the most powerful items of a shaman's paraphernalia.
Doctors are reported to have captured eagles and even
to have tried to raise them to obtain feathers (223-231)
The tail feathers were the most prized. Eagle feathers
were extremely valuable and could be traded for anything
including <span class="tei tei-q">“a woman or a sack of pine-nut flour
or anything worth a lot.”</span> Ideally the eagle was tied up
until the shaman removed three tail feathers. The doctor
then tied a string of beads to the bird's leg and
released it as a messenger to the spirits. Description
of eagle-down costumes suggest that birds were stripped
of many more feathers than the ideal three. In historic
times individuals have attempted to contain eagles. One
old man in Woodfords is well known for having kept
them on cradle-boards for easy transport, but such
experiments usually ended in failure. Magpie feathers
were considered less powerful than eagle feathers but
still were highly prized. Today they are gathered by
chance—taken from dead birds on the highway or picked
up where they were shed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the past, eagle and magpie feathers were important
parts of the dress of warriors. Magpie feathers
were used to make a feather cap with a single feather
suspended from the top. Informants recall their elders'
describing eagle feathers' being suspended individually
from the upper arms and thighs of particularly powerful
warriors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Modern peyotists have lost none of the traditional
Washo feeling about these feathers. The ceremonial
fans of road chiefs, believed the only persons capable
of handling the immense power, are made of eagle
feathers. Other peyotists favor the less powerful but
nonetheless potent magpie feather (d'Azevedo and Merriam
1957).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tobacco, as the foregoing accounts illustrate, played
an important part in Washo shamanism. It appears to
have been used as an offering to the spirits. In addition
it is clear that it was felt to have special power
of its own. Today older men smoke sparingly and are
often somewhat embarrassed to be offered a cigarette
casually during conversation. In prewhite times the
tobacco was a native variety gathered and dried by the
shaman. Today Bull Durham appears to have replaced
the wild variety as <span class="tei tei-q">“Indian”</span> tobacco. The Indians seemed
delighted to see me rolling a cigarette; they acted as
if I were mastering what they felt was a particularly
Indian art. Bull Durham is also important in peyote
ceremonialism because it is <span class="tei tei-q">“real Indian tobacco.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Incense cedar plays an important role in modern
peyote meetings. It is dried and thrown into the fire
to create a fragment smoke which is considered beneficial.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Meeting officials fan it into the atmosphere and
<span class="tei tei-q">“rub”</span> themselves in the smoke to obtain power or
purification. This has a connection with traditional
Washo ritual, but the relationship is unclear and the
aboriginal practices obscure. One group of Washo,
which was assigned a special place in the large camp
circle formed during the pine-nut dances held at
Double Springs Flats in the late nineteenth century,
is said to have special rights in connection with cutting
cedar. Modern informants do not have a clear
picture of what the rights were or what the customs
surrounding cedar were. One informant did say that
if the cedar <span class="tei tei-q">“bunch”</span> found anyone else with cedar they
would say <span class="tei tei-q">“you aren't supposed to have that”</span> and would
make fun of them. She could offer no further details
or explanations.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no real distinction in the Washo mind between
a doctor and a sorcerer or witch. Particularly
powerful doctors were able to kill their enemies. One
of the most feared bits of paraphernalia was an obsidian
point found by a doctor. These large points were
not made by Washo and are apparently remnants of
some previous cultural occupation in the area. If a
Washo finds one point up he carefully knocks it over
with a long stick before touching it. These points are
called mankillers, but I was unable to learn exactly
how they were used. They are still viewed with a certain
amount of awe, and the finding of a large point
in a sandpit in Smith Valley was known in Woodfords,
fifty miles away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sorcery was used to explain the abandonment of an
ancient campsite at Dangberg's Hot Springs. This site
is a trove of grinding stones, points, and other Washo
artifacts. Formerly there were numerous skeletons in
the area, according to both Indian and white informants.
However, the site has not been occupied in historic
times because of the following incident.

him. But he was mad at them people so he went
to Markleville and made a lot of medicine. [Why
he went to Markleville is unclear. This is the site
of another hot springs, a fact which may figure in
the magic used.] After he made medicine for a
while he kind of spit on his fingers and pointed at
Dangberg Hot Springs. Right where he pointed all
the grass got brown; you can still see that line of
brown if you know where to look, and a lot of Indians
died. Nobody ever went back there. My old
aunt she didn't die.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Only one Washo disputed this story. She, a very
progressive old woman and sometime Christian, attributed
the deaths to an epidemic and <span class="tei tei-q">“didn't think”</span> the
doctor was responsible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Witchcraft and sorcery among the present-day
Washo is a difficult subject to investigate. Even among
themselves it is treated with extreme indirection and
veiled hints. In discussing the problem with d'Azevedo
I found that we were in agreement that a number of
killings reported among these people could probably be

use of power.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One woman, now dead, was described as probably
a witch. The wife of the diviner mentioned earlier was
considered a powerful and dangerous woman. She was
useful to the community because she knew prayers and
songs for the pine-nut celebration, but dangerous, particularly
if she met you at night. One informant describes the
attitude of the rest of the community toward her.

The Washo have not engaged in real hostilities with
the Miwok or Maidu for well over a century and Paiute
hostilities appear to have taken the form of occasional
defensive skirmishes; thus the details of war magic
are vague. However, Washo tradition repeatedly mentions
a month-long period during which doctors gathered
and made medicine against the enemy before
launching a campaign. Usually this took place at Woodfords,
which was the site of a large earth lodge dance
house copied after Miwok structures and described as
<span class="tei tei-q">“where the young mens learned them Miwok dances.”</span>
(A second dance house is known to have existed in
Sierra Valley; attributed to the Maidu, it fell into disuse
after the death of its owner.)

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">Summary Of Shamanism</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although there appears to be only a single practicing
shaman among the Washo today (and he certainly
not a practitioner of the old school), it would be a
mistake, in my opinion, to claim that Washo shamanism
is a thing of the past. Few, if any, Washo over
forty have not attended a shamanistic curing ceremony
and many have been patients. Even those Indians who
have rejected shamanism as old fashioned—or in deference
to white attitudes—give one the impression of
<span class="tei tei-q">“protesting too much”</span> in their denial of old beliefs.
The woman who took her granddaughter to Rupert, the
curer, is among the most progressive of the Washo.
She is a nominal Christian, active in an informal way
as a representative of her people before white authority,
and is most apt to deny supernatural explanations
of historic incidents. Nonetheless she has faith in the
power of this modern shaman and in the cures reported
for the old-time shamans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One factor in the decline of the shaman as a principal
in curative activities was the rise of the peyote
cult in the mid-1930's (Stewart 1944). The cult was
introduced by a Paiute who gathered a number of
Washo followers. His cult or <span class="tei tei-q">“way”</span> has since been
superseded by a strictly Washo group, following the
Teepee Way (d'Azevedo 1957). The Teepee Way is an
illustration of the effect an ethnographer can have on
the lives of his subjects. A casual remark by an ethnographer
that the peyote ceremonies carried out by
the Paiute leader were not like those he had seen
elsewhere motivated a Washo to drive to Idaho to find
out for himself. This trip resulted in the formation of
the new cult and the near dissolution of the group
headed by the Paiute. Washo peyotism has incorporated
much of the curing emphasis of Washo shamanism and
much of the symbolism as well. The peyote button is
reminiscent of the poison parsnip taken by old-time
doctors (d'Azevedo 1957). The powerful eagle feather
is reserved for the use of road chiefs just as it was
the special symbol of the shaman or powerful warrior.
The fans carried by most peyotists are often composed
of magpie feathers. Curative peyote meetings are often
conducted by a special chief, reputed to have very potent
curing powers, who does not conduct the regular
peyote meeting. Even in regular meetings one of the
main emphases is on curing ailments of both the body
and spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Led by an assimilated Washo, known by other Indians
as a <span class="tei tei-q">“white man's Indian,”</span> the shamans brought
suit against the peyotists urging they be arrested and
their meetings banned. They charged, among other
things, that peyote meetings were occasions of sexual
license. Such open accusations and the bringing of
white men into a strictly Indian matter created a great
deal of antagonism toward the shamans among the
Washo, whether or not they were committed to peyote.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Peyote curing differs only in detail from shamanistic
curing as these two stories may illustrate.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Had these gallstones and them white doctors
operated and they got a lotta little stones but pretty
soon it was back. So I decided to pray. You know
whenever an Indian wants to pray the first thing he
turns to is water and tobacco. So every night when
I went to the john [toilet] I'd roll a cigarette and
pray to that Peyote. I'd say, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I don't want to be
sick so you got to help them white doctors. You
got to get all those little stones together in one

go to meetings and it helped me before. So every
night I prayed to the Peyote to get them stones in
one place. Then I went to the hospital and they operated
and got out the biggest gallstone they ever
saw. It would hardly go in a fruit jar. I told that
Peyote that the job was too big for it all alone that
it should just help them white doctors and get all
them stones in one place.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another informant, mentioned earlier as a peyote
chief with special curing power, recounts the events
leading up to the death of his former wife of cancer
of the kidneys.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

helped her too. Except she would not do the things
I told her to do. I made that cancer move around
from her back where it hurt a lot. I got it around
in front where it didn't hurt her so much. But she
wouldn't keep doing the things I told her to do.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These two incidents reveal traditional attitudes transferred
into a new framework of curing. In the first
place, illness is a corporeal object which can be manipulated—moved
and (if one's power is sufficient) removed.
Secondly, peyote is viewed as a manifestation
of a spiritual power. The informant with gallstones did
not attend meetings to have his ailment cured; rather,
he used water and tobacco, traditional adjuncts to shamanistic
curing. Moreover he did not take peyote for
his illness; he simply prayed to Peyote in a manner
very similar to praying to a spirit guardian for assistance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other shadows of the shamanistic past seem to lie
heavily on the minds of modern Washo peyotists. In
his discussion of peyotism, d'Azevedo (1957, pp. 624-626)
describes in some detail the attitudes about the
assistance or interference that one peyote singer or
drummer may receive from another. The statements
of his informants, although couched in different terms,
are reminiscent of many I heard dealing with competitions
between shamans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For several years peyotists were a powerful factor
in the tribal council, and they were not loath to play
upon the connection between peyote and poison parsnips
in the minds of their cotribalists. The peyote button is
considered to be a powerful agent and as such potentially
dangerous. Therefore a man who could deal with this
agent, just like a shaman who could eat the poison parsnip
with impunity, was a man to be listened to and
followed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Despite a belief in and a dependence on shamanistic
curing or its latter-day counterpart, the peyote curing
session, most Washo are willing patients of white doctors.
This suggests that perhaps the old views are disappearing
under the scientific certainty of Western
medicine. Quite the reverse seems true, however. Every
failure of white medicine strengthens the Indians' belief
that the real source of curing power is a gift from
nature. Every success is attributed to assistance the
white men have received from Indians' power. When
asked the direct question: <span class="tei tei-q">“Why aren't there so many
Indian doctors today?”</span> my informant answered: <span class="tei tei-q">“Well,
Indians just don't need all that power today. The white
doctors know a lot of things and can cure sickness
pretty good. In the old days we didn't know them things
so we had to have them real powers.”</span> This attitude,
that nature provided whatever was necessary for Washo
survival, crops up in other contexts which I will discuss
later in this paper. Far from disappearing, the
old notions seem to be maintaining a strong hold on
the minds of the Washo. As the number of active peyotists
dwindle (d'Azevedo and Merriam 1957), one gets
the impression that the shamanistic forms may again
become a more important part of Washo life.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mentioned almost as frequently as doctors are
dreamers, whom the Washo view as distinct from
shamans. The so-called antelope shaman and rabbit
boss fall into this category rather than that of doctor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dreamers were gifted with a power to foretell special
classes of events in dreams. All Washo believe
dreams are likely to foretell the future, and they are
alert to find meanings in any dreams they have. Certain
persons, those thought of as <span class="tei tei-q">“dreamers,”</span> are reported
to have special gifts of this nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are apparently no dreamers among the Washo
today, in the sense that the term was used in times
past. That is, no one is especially singled out as having
infallible dreams foretelling certain classes of
events. It may be that the breakdown of the band structure,
which was related to economic exploitative activity,
in effect, forced everyone to dream for himself. In
the past, dreamers were particularly important in setting
the time and place for activities which were carried
out by large groups, such as hunting, fishing,
pine-nut gathering, and war. With the disappearance
of the last seminomadic bands in the middle 1920's,
as well as with the reduced importance of hunting and
fishing as group activities, persons having dreams
which directed group actions were no longer useful.
Today, dreams appear to occur to a number of individuals,
and those felt to be of social significance usually
deal with catastrophe or other foreboding subjects.
The following stories were told to me by the widow
under the shadow of witchcraft. When I asked her if
she thought any of her friends would tell me their
dreams, she replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“No I don't think no Washo would
tell you their dreams. But I'm not superstitious about
them things and I'll tell you these two dreams I had.”</span>
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">One summer I was up at the Lake [Tahoe] with my
husband and I had a dream that the gambling house at
Dresslerville [a structure known officially as the community
center] was on fire. There was kids inside and
they was screaming but there wasn't no water. I saw
the men all around with buckets but they couldn't do
nothing because there wasn't no water. I told my husband
about the dream the next morning and he said I
should take a bath and pray. That's what we do to keep
a bad dream from happening.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following winter the community center did in fact
burn down. A young Indian in a rage after having an argument
with his father hurled a bottle of kerosene against
a wood stove. The resulting fire could not be extinguished
because the Dresslerville pump was not working. Whether
the dream was really a prophecy after the fact I do not
know. It is significant in any case that the prophecy appeared
in the form of a dream. My informant's second
dream foretold the violent death of a young Indian woman.
The prophecy came true two years later.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Her statement that other Washo would be reluctant to
discuss their dreams was all too true, confirming the
importance that dreams play in their daily lives. A number
of tangential remarks suggest that the belief that
dreams confer advance knowledge of the future and that
they confer power is still common among the Washo. One
informant said, in talking about <span class="tei tei-q">“old-time dreamers”</span>:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Today a lot of people will say they had a dream about
something, and act real big. I just tell them they are
crazy. They aren't real dreamers. They couldn't have a
dream about their girl friend.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Until very recent times a dream was justification for
almost any group activity. The most common motivation
for such events as a pine-nut dance, a war party, or a
rabbit or antelope drive was usually that <span class="tei tei-q">“So-and-So had
a dream.”</span> An announcement would be made and others
would gather for the event.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These dreams are clearly different from the visitations
of spirits to prospective shamans, which occurred repeatedly
and were kept secret. Dreamers, on the other hand,
publicly reported individual dreams. Being a dreamer
appears to have been one of the important factors in attaining
positions of leadership, informal as such positions
were among the Washo. The almost legendary Captain
Jim,<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> who was acknowledged as a leader by all the Washo
in the late nineteenth century, is considered to have been
a dreamer by many of the Washo. Those informants who
remember the big times at Double Springs Flat, in which
a large number of the Washo of the day participated prior
to the pine-nut harvest, usually begin their accounts with
the statement that Jim would have a dream and announce
the date of the meeting. Various parts of the ceremony
were also validated by dreams. It is equally clear that
although Jim was an honored leader and had dreaming
power he was not considered a doctor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Negative testimony also indicates the importance of
dreaming in Washo life. It is to the advantage of certain
individuals to deny the <span class="tei tei-q">“chieftainship”</span> of Captain Jim;
they vehemently deny that he was a dreamer but insist
that he was simply a good man who was trusted by the
Washo. <span class="tei tei-q">“That Jim was just a good old guy that everybody
obeyed because they liked him and the whole group selected
him. He wasn't no more of a dreamer than I am,”</span>
is the way one claimant for the Washo chieftainship put
it. However, his own claim was based on his relationship
to a man who was a rabbit boss and who dreamed when
it was time to hunt rabbits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Clearly the Washo believed and still believe that dreams
make one privy to the future and provide important insights
on which one can base decisions. The specific uses to
which dreams can be put change with the situation. Antelope
dreaming is no longer important because there are
no antelope. Rabbit dreamers no longer exist because the
rabbit drive has lost much of its importance in Washo life.
Conversely, dreams dealing with modern problems appear
to be taken seriously.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One informant often dreams of snakes and evidences a
great fear of them. The Washo view this behavior as a
rational response to a real warning and consider the man's
caution as good judgment in the face of repeated warnings.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Few, if any, Washo activities do not contain an element
which we can describe as religious, supernatural,
or magical. This element is most commonly revealed
by specifically ritualized behavior carried on while a
regular course of action is being taken by a Washo.
The following sections will deal with this ritualized
behavior and the rationale for it offered by the Washo.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">Conception And Contraception</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Apparently the Washo have no specific ritual to encourage
conception. They are extremely fond of children
and desire as many as possible. No Washo has
ever heard of, or will admit having heard of, infanticide
among the Washo, although they have heard of
the practice among other Indians. The birth of an illegitimate
child, despite the attitude of whites, is
greeted with as much joy as that of a legitimate child.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, it is believed that conception can be prevented
by manipulation of the afterbirth. When the
afterbirth is expelled it is wrapped in a piece of deer
hide or cloth and buried. It is always placed right side
up if a woman desires to continue bearing children. If
she wishes not to have children it is buried upside
down. If at a later time she wishes to become pregnant,
she will turn the earth where the upside-down
afterbirth was buried. Informants say that not many
people do this any more, mainly because younger
women go to the hospital to have their babies, but
that many people know how and some may still do it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Certain Indians are reported to be able to prevent
the birth of children without the knowledge of the woman
concerned. This requires the cooperation of a
woman who has just had a child and who will give the
magician the afterbirth. It is then buried or hidden
upside down and the woman concerned will not become
pregnant. The method of transferring the influence of
the afterbirth from the real mother to the victim was
not explained, and in fact the practice was revealed
with a good deal of reluctance.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Informants report that the baby was not touched,
either by the mother or her attendants, until the afterbirth
was expelled. The birth and recuperation were
carried out in a pit filled with warm ashes. A slow
birth was blamed on the belief that the mother had
slept too much or been lazy during her pregnancy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mother was not allowed to eat salt until the
baby's umbilicus dropped off, usually in two or three
days. The umbilicus was dried and hung on the right
side of the cradleboard to insure that the baby would
be right-handed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The baby's hair was cut about thirty days after its
birth. Until that time the mother was not permitted to
eat meat or to leave her bed of ashes. However, one
of my informants who had borne eight children claimed
never to have spent more than two weeks in her lying-in
bed. She did insist that <span class="tei tei-q">“in the old days”</span> women
adhered to the traditional thirty-day period.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A pregnant woman was not permitted to eat eggs
with double yolks, or double fruit, lest she have twins.
No special action was taken if twins were born, however.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During her confinement a woman was not supposed
to rub the sweat from her face. She might dab the
sweat off, but to rub it would cause her to be wrinkled
in her old age. One informant assured me that this
was the truth and pointed to her own relatively unwrinkled
face as proof.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When a child loses a milk tooth, it is taken up and
thrown into the brush. At that time an admonition is

it should exchange the milk tooth for a good permanent
one (2295a-2301)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Aside from the <span class="tei tei-q">“big times”</span> which will be described
later, the girls' puberty dance was the most important
ceremonial gathering among the Washo. This custom
has survived with tenacity and it is still considered a
matter of real concern if for some reason a girl does
not have <span class="tei tei-q">“her dance.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although much of the activity at a girls' dance is
clearly social throughout the occasion, there is a series
of ritual actions which must be carried out. The following
account is an idealized version of the <span class="tei tei-q">“old way.”</span>
Other accounts will describe variations which have developed
in the past years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Certain statements which I make will appear to be
at variance with Stewart's Culture Element Distribution
Lists. However, I am inclined to think that the absence
of traits in the memory of my own informants represents
a pattern of change rather than inaccuracies on
the part of earlier investigators. With minor exceptions,
differences between statements made today and Stewart's
lists take the form of traits marked present in the
lists which are unknown to my own informants. Moreover,
most of these differences are to be found in the
hair-combing and scratching complex and suggest that
the taboos on hair combing were abandoned some time
between the childhood of his informants, who were in
their seventies in 1936, and that of my own informants,
who are in their seventies today (1959).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The parents of my informants must not have known
or not enforced combing taboos, while the parents of
Stewart's informants must have considered them proper
and so instructed their children. We can speculate, on
this basis, that the taboo on hair combing and scratching
was abandoned by the Washo some time in the first
half of the century. Whether this can be credited to the
influence of the white man or to a continuing pattern
of change is a matter for further investigation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The account of the entire puberty complex which
follows was given to me by a seventy-five-year-old
Washo woman who is generally consulted whenever a
family plans to hold the girls' dance.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">When a girl is about ten she is told what is

active and not to be lazy. She drinks only warm
water. In the old days anything that she gathered
anyone could come along and take. She couldn't eat
meat or salt but Washo don't think eggs are the
same as meat.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(This last statement was in response to direct
questions and does not reflect special Washo traits.
In fact, all food appears to have been forbidden for
four days.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The family of the girl immediately prepares as
much food as possible to feed the guests. One informant
remembers in his youth that a family of a girl
eligible for a dance would light a large fire part way
up on Job's Peak to announce the event.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dance itself is carried out at night. Singing
and hand-clapping accompany the dancing, which may
go on all night. During the dance the girl carries a
wand about six or seven feet long. The wand is made
of a very light wood, often elderberry, and painted
red with a native pigment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the past, groups camped about Dresslerville
staged their dances at the base of a prominent hill
nearby. During the night the girl was required to run
to the top of the hill and light four fires; this practice
has been discontinued for many years, however, apparently
as a result of white accusations that the Indians
started range fires and also to avoid attracting
curious whites.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About dawn one of the girl's male relatives ran
forward and snatched the stick from her. He then ran
with it into the hills and hid it in an upright position
in some out-of-the-way place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The elderberry wand is a device used to insure
the girl's continued agility and lightness of foot. As
long as the hidden stick remains unbroken the girl
will remain straight and agile.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the stick was taken away, an older female
relative took a small amount of ash on a whisk of
sage, and dusted the nude girl on the head, arms,
and legs. This ritual was accompanied by an informal
prayer that the girl not suffer pains in her head,
arms, or legs. She was told: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am doing this early
in the morning so that you will get up early in the
morning and work hard.”</span> The whisk was then thrown
into the crowd, along with a gift, which today is usually
a bit of money. Food or beads were apparently
used in the past.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the dusting, a basketful of water was brought
forward and the girl was bathed. The basket was then
thrown into the crowd. This was considered a high
point of the celebration. After she was bathed, a few
dabs of native pigment were placed on her chest and
face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ceremony above was described as the <span class="tei tei-q">“real
way to do it ... the way they did it in the old days.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Carson Valley Record Courier reports a puberty
dance held in the summer of 1919 in which at
least some of these activities were observed (although
the reporter thought he was attending a betrothal dance)
Some two-hundred Indians were in attendance. There
were no fires, only lanterns and flashlights. The participants
had taken up a collection and purchased watermelon,
ice cream, cake, pie, bread, and meat for the
feast. The food was served (to the surprise of the reporter)
on a long table with plates. About midnight two
girls appeared in the center of the dancing circle carrying
long wands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1926 Lowie witnessed a girls' dance near Minden
and was obviously unimpressed. The crowd gathered
slowly and gradually began to dance. He makes no
mention of either the wand or the ash-dusting ritual,
nor does he give us details of the feast. The bath was
given from a tin can, and he does not report a basket's
being thrown (Lowie 1939, pp. 305-308).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One suspects that dances held today are somewhat
more elaborate than those of three or four decades
ago, possibly as a response to increasing awareness
and pride in the fact of Indianness. Certainly every
girl expects to have her dance, just as a debutante
expects to have a coming-out party. When death in the
family made it inadvisable to hold a dance on a girl's
first menstrual period, everyone agreed that it was
indeed a shame. The girl went through her four-day
fast and a small party was held for her when her
second period occurred. One informant insisted that
in the <span class="tei tei-q">“old days”</span> a dance was always held on the occasion
of a girl's second period but that this had long
since been abandoned (Cartwright, 1952, confirms).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The basket plays an important part in the ceremony
and it would be considered improper if there were no
basket to be thrown to the crowd. It is best if the
basket is well made and can actually hold the ceremonial
bath water. If such a basket cannot be obtained,
and they are growing rarer as the older basket makers
die, the bath is poured from a bucket, but a less fancy
basket is still thrown to the crowd. The bath and dusting
are now given to the girl while clad in her slip,
in deference to white notions of modesty which are
strictly observed by the Washo. The painting is carried
out only if native pigment is available. The wand
is left unpainted unless native pigments are available.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ritual of seizing and hiding the wand is carried
out perfunctorily. During a recent dance the girl's
uncle took the wand but simply carried it to the grandmother's
house, intending to take it to the mountains
later. However, the stick remained with the grandmother,
who was somewhat concerned about it. It was
kept in an upright position, and she constantly reminded
the man that he should take it. He regularly promised
that he would, the next time he came to visit, but just
as regularly forgot it. It may well be that as an adult
and an important peyote chief, he was reluctant to
carry out what he considered an old Indian superstition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no indication now that the girls' puberty
dance is dying out among the Washo. It may well be
changing in form and developing into more of a party.
As the number of persons who know white dances increases,
these may replace Indian dances. There is
some suggestion of this in other ceremonial activities.
And of course the fact that future generations of Washo
girls will attend integrated Nevada public schools and
associate with white students with different aspirations
for approaching adulthood may have important effects
on the future of the girls' dance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pine-nut flour seems to have taken on an important
symbolic role in latter-day dances. We see no mention
of this food in 1919 or 1926. Today it might be considered
proper to delay holding a dance if it was not
possible to get enough pine-nut flour to feed the crowd.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The approaching maturity of a boy cannot be measured
in dramatic physiological terms, and puberty is
considered to occur about when a boy's voice changes.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The ritual for boys is less important than that for
girls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The emphasis for a boy is on his developing ability
as a hunter. Although hunting is far less important
today than it was even in the recent past, few Washo
go through the winter without depending on rabbit or
deer for meat. The pursuit of the squirrel, ground
squirrel, gopher, and other small game appears to be
minimal, but certainly this food is not spurned, if
available. One of the common legal conflicts with the
white man stems from out-of-season hunting during
the winter by Washo men filling out the family larder.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Young boys were encouraged to hunt with bow and
arrow as soon as they could. Quite often such training
was carried out by an older male relative—a grandfather
or an old uncle. Expeditions of old men and
young boys after chipmunk and squirrel appear to have
been common, freeing able-bodied men for major hunting
while the experienced, but less able, older men
instructed the boys.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, all the game taken by a boy was taboo to
his immediate family. This included young deer and
does which he might kill. Such game was given to another
family, usually related. The boy was also forbidden
to eat his own take. The taboo included any
fish the boy caught.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When a boy killed a buck deer considered by his
father or other male relative to be big enough, he
went through a simple ceremony. One informant said
that in the old days a boy was required to crawl under
the antlers of his kill. His father or older male relative
then gave him a bath, and from that time he was
considered a man and the taboo on his kill was lifted
from himself and his family.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My informant, a mother of four sons now over
forty, stated that all her sons had gone through the
taboo period and were bathed by their father when
they killed their first big buck. Until very recently
she received meat from some relatives with a young
son who hunted frequently.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether or not the young Washo are still observing
this taboo and ritual I was unable to determine. However,
in certain conservative families it seems probable
that at least minimal ritual is observed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Marriage is entirely a social institution, and no
religious elements appear to have entered into it.
Traditionally the ceremony, if there was any at all,
consisted of a <span class="tei tei-q">“chief”</span> (respected man) throwing a
blanket over the shoulders of a couple at a dance.
Ceremonial gatherings, such as the pine-nut dances
and the girls' dances were important in the selection
of marriage partners, inasmuch as boys and girls
came together at these gatherings to engage in flirtation,
affairs, and courtship. Dreamers at the <span class="tei tei-q">“big

married couples to be good to each other and not
fight (see also Lowie 1939, p. 303).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No amount of social dislocation or cultural impact
alters the constant fact of death. Each generation faces
this inevitability. It is less than surprising then that
changes in attitudes and rituals surrounding death
among the Washo have changed very slowly. The only
changes which appear to have developed in Washo death
customs are those imposed by direct intervention of
the whites or as unavoidable consequences of changes
in other aspects of the culture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the past, when a person died the house in which
he expired was abandoned by his family. Of course, if
the death occurred in the spring or summer such abandonment
was simple; during these seasons the Washo
usually lived in simple brush shelters. A winter death
was a more serious matter; it was during this season
that the Washo lived in the gal'sdaɲl—a structure
made to last through the winter and until the next
winter, when it was reoccupied. Valley Washo often
made these winter homes of brush or tules. In the
foothills and mountains, bark slabs and tree limbs
were utilized. If an occupant died, this home must be
abandoned and was often burned down, and the immediate
family moved to another campsite. Thus a family
which suffered no deaths during the winters might
spend several years in a single campground, whereas
a less fortunate family might have to move every
winter, or even oftener than that.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few Washo began building simple rectangular
board and batten houses in the 1890's. Most of the
others continued to live in gal'sdaɲ¿l made of boards
and scrap, begged, stolen, or purchased from the lumber
mills which were quite numerous in the area at
the beginning of the century. In the 1920's, when most
of the Washo moved into the <span class="tei tei-q">“colonies”</span> established for
them by the government, the native-style houses were
abandoned in favor of the wooden homes built by the
government. No longer permitted to move about the
country at will, and frankly unwilling to abandon the
more comfortable white-style houses, the Washo adjusted
their death customs. The most common adjustment
was to prepare for an impending death by shifting
seriously ill persons into an adjoining structure,
often a shack built in the native manner or a shed or
lean-to. This structure could be burned down without
loss when its inhabitant died.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Washo viewed this destruction of a house occupied
by a dead person as simply preventing his spirit
from bothering the living.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most Washo death customs display a conscious attempt
to avoid association with the dead. Barrett reports
that cremation was practiced, and the bones
placed in a stream to prevent their desecration. However,
this appears to have been only one of the disposal
customs and is not well remembered by Washo
living today. The burning or burying of the personal
possessions of the dead was common. Certain prized
possessions were interred with the body, which was
usually wrapped in a shroud of matting, deerskin, or
bearhide and placed in a fissure or cave in the mountains.
Although there are a number of locations known
by both Indians and local whites as old burying grounds,
all my informants agreed that in the <span class="tei tei-q">“real old days”</span>
there was no special cemetery and that these burial
spots have developed since the coming of the white
man. This may well have been as a result of direct
white interference with native funeral customs and an
insistence that Indians concentrate their burials. Some
of these sites have become traditional among the Washo.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dispute between the widow and the sister mentioned
earlier was an argument as to whether the deceased
would be buried in one of these sites or in the cemetery
at Stewart, Nevada.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A white man who has lived in the area for ninety
years, reported that as a boy he often came across
caches of belongings of dead Indians in the mountains.
Today, prized possessions are either crowded into the
casket with the body or burned or secreted in some
remote area of the Sierra.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Funeral ceremonies were apparently simple. The
body was wrapped and carried into the hills to be interred.
Prayers in the form of a short speech were
directed toward the dead. <span class="tei tei-q">“We are burying you because
you are dead. It's not because we are mad at you or
don't like you. But you are dead. Please don't come
back and bother us.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Widows traditionally cut their hair in mourning, a
custom which is still practiced. Stewart reports that
mourners painted their faces black. My informants
denied this, but one elaborated: <span class="tei tei-q">“I remember when I
was a little girl old Indians who had lost someone
would cry a lot and let the tears run down their faces
and not wash their faces until they were real dirty
and black with fire smoke.”</span> Crying at a funeral was
expected and in fact positively sanctioned. At a funeral
conducted while I was present the sheriff arrested a
drunken Washo who was wailing quite loudly. The Indians
were all bitter about this because: <span class="tei tei-q">“All of us
cry at a funeral whether we are drunk or not. That's
the way the Washo do it.”</span> (This funeral was that of a
murder victim and the sheriff was present because he
feared there might be a reprisal attempt.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A newspaper report of a funeral in Genoa, Nevada,
in the late 1880's records that the Indians had borrowed
a wagon from a white man to transport the
corpse (that of a well-known Indian woman) to the
burying ground. The wagon was followed by a large
crowd of weeping mourners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Modern funerals usually take place under the auspices
of a funeral director, and generally services are
performed by a Christian minister from the Stewart
Indian agency. After the white minister has left, it is
usual for an older Indian to approach the casket and
repeat the old funeral prayers. The reason for waiting
until the minister leaves is to avoid hurting his
feelings. My informants said the prayers made the
older Indians feel more comfortable. It is usually not
necessary to burn the deceased's home, but his belongings
are disposed of. There is an increasing tendency
to tend graves and put flowers on them. The
cemetery at Stewart appears to be well decorated with
flowers. Two old Indian graves near Lake Tahoe are
regularly visited and jars of flowers placed on them.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the husband of one of my informants died,
following a twelve-year illness spent in a secondary
house, she went to visit a daughter living near Lake
Tahoe. When she returned to Dresslerville her two
sons had torn down the shed and disposed of all their
father's possessions. In deference to their mother's
rather modern views about funerals, nothing had been
placed in the casket.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While I was in Dresslerville an Indian of about
forty put the torch to the house in which his mother
and father had lived. The house had been unoccupied
since their deaths. While the house burned no effort
was made to extinguish the fire or to call the fire
department. A nearby rancher saw the fire and summoned
the fire department, but the Indians refused to
tell the firemen how the fire had started. The local
newspaper reported it had been burned to drive away
evil spirits. This upset my informants, one of whom
said that the sight of the house simply made the man
sad. She elaborated that the Washo felt they were helping
God wipe out the tracks of a dead person. The
Washo claim that after a death there is always a rain
or sand storm which wipes out the tracks of the deceased.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the Washo return home from a funeral, they
immediately wash their faces and hands. They would
not feel safe in handling food or children until this
ritual had been carried out.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The behavior of the dead is a matter of concern
for most Washo (2606-2609a). Ideally, the spirit is
supposed to go up and to the south where dead Indians
are. This land of the dead is guarded by a number of
men with bows. Some shamans were able to make the
trip to the land of the dead (2541-2544). If they could
elude these guards, they were sometimes able to recover
the spirit of a recently dead person and return
it. If, however, the spirit has partaken of the water
of a spring immediately behind the guards, it can never
be recovered. The by-now-familiar uncle of my informant
once visited the land of the dead and reported that
there were lots of Indians there playing games and
having a good time. If murder victims were present
they were with the celebrants, but the spirits of the
killers were segregated and were not having a good
time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ghosts, however, wander over the land. They are
generally malevolent. If they feel they have been badly
used in life, or are not properly honored after death,
or have not been given the things they wanted when
buried, they may wreak vengeance on the living. To prevent
this, homes were abandoned, prayers were said, and
names of the dead were not used. In discussing a recent
murder, one of the most progressive of the Washo was
extremely reluctant to give the name of the victim, and,
when she finally did, she whispered it. One of the difficulties
encountered by government agents when pine-nut
lands were allotted to the Washo was a refusal to name
the ancestors on whom the allotment claim was based.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ghosts are often said to come in the form of whirlwinds
or dust devils, and most Washo will avoid looking
at a whirlwind. At night, a sudden puff of warm
air is thought to be a ghost passing nearby.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hunting, far more than gathering, appears to have
been the focus of much ritual activity. This suggests
that for the Washo the importance of ritual may have
increased in proportion to the element of chance inherent
in the activity undertaken. Gathering was a
surety, assuming of course that there was a harvest
to gather. With the wide variety of plants available
within the Washo territory during the spring, summer,
and fall it seems highly unlikely that the failure of
one species of plant created a serious problem. This,
of course, was not true of the pine nut. A failure of
the pine-nut crop was a harbinger of a starvation
winter. The gathering of pine nuts, in contrast to the
gathering of other plants, was the subject of a great
deal of ritual and, in some degree, of ceremonialism
uncommon to most Washo gathering activities. This
will be dealt with later in the paper.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deer</span></span> (1-27).—Deer were hunted in a number of
ways. Barrett reports, and old informants confirm,
that hunting parties of as many as thirty or forty
men were formed in the old days to go to the western
slope of the Sierra in pursuit of deer. The large number
may have been necessitated by the possibility of
meeting hostile Miwok or Maidu. My own informants
claimed that these large parties often set fire to the
forest to drive the deer into the open, and that the
large number of men was needed to cover the escape
routes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
More common, apparently, were small groups of
five or six men, usually relatives, who went into the
deer country together. Their technique was to drive
along a single deer run toward one of their number
who was considered the best shot. This method was
very common after the introduction of firearms, particularly
repeating firearms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, any Washo man might hunt singly. Often
groups of five or six men went hunting together but
each did his own stalking.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever the technique, hunting magic was an individual
affair which did not require any ceremonial activities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A single hunter, before the days of firearms, often
stalked in the antlers and hide of a deer. Washo were
often superstitious about using the real antlers and
made artificial sets from manzanita branches. This
fear of using real antlers appears related to the treatment
which was accorded to the bones of deer. These,
once the meat had been completely stripped off, were
submerged in a stream to prevent their being eaten
by dogs or wild animals. Perhaps the best account of
the magic involved in stalking is the following by an

then cover up with a deer hide. They'd move along

buck would try to get to the side away from the

he wouldn't smell you. Finally you could get real
close, maybe only three, four feet ... going around
making sounds just like a deer. Sometimes them
bucks would really believe you and want to fight
and then it was dangerous. When you was close you
shot that arrow into the deer right behind the shoulder
blade. That way when he jumped, the shoulder
blade comes back and breaks off the shaft. The man
would grab the shaft and suck off the blood. Then
he'd make a little fire on a flat stone and when it
was hot he'd sweep off the fire and spit that on
the stone and it would bubble up and disappear.
Then you'd go after the deer and you'd find him
laying there with blood bubbling out of his nose
just like that blood bubbled on the stone.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other rituals related to hunting dealt with the loss
of hunting luck. To regain one's luck in hunting, a
sweat lodge was built, consisting of a temporary brush
shelter (688-759).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To insure luck it was common in the old days to
bathe and rub the leaves of a certain mountain plant
over one's body. Other Washo carried a plant on their
persons while hunting, to insure luck. I was unable to
get my informant to give me the Washo name of this
plant. Certain other special medicines are reported.
One man, it is hinted, has a medicine which he rubs
on his gun to insure good aim. Old hunters are said
to have obtained medicine from the Miwok which would
put deer to sleep. Today this medicine is a subject of
esoteric humor between my informant and his son-in-law.
The latter insists that the bear has a medicine
which will put his father-in-law to sleep because he
came upon the old man asleep under a tree one day
when he should have been hunting. Although the Washo
depended on ritual to assist them in hunting, it is
clear that they considered a successful hunter the possessor
of power beyond simple magic. Like curers or
dreamers, certain hunters obviously had been blessed
by spirits and were able to outthink and outsmart animals
and therefore were particularly good hunters.
At least some of the Washo who hunt today attempt
to give the impression that their success is based on
something more than luck or skill.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antelope</span></span> (27a-75).—There are no Washo alive today
who can remember antelope surrounds. It appears
that most of the Washo territory was not inhabited
by antelope, lying as it does between the northern and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
southern ranges of the Nevada herds. However, small
herds did range in the eastern portion of Washo country,
but the appearance of firearms and livestock eliminated
the antelope completely in this area. One informant,
himself seventy-five, remembers stories
about the hunts, told to him by a very old brother-in-law
who remembered the antelope songs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another informant, generally a good source of hunting
information, admitted that he did not know anything
about the subject. He had never hunted antelope, nor
had his father or uncles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The signal to hunt was a dream announcing the
presence of antelope to a dreamer, who acted as
leader of the hunt. The entire process was considered
to be magical by this informant who said:
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">There was really no corral. Mebbe just a few
piles of brush. The people just danced around and
sang, and that kept them antelope there like they
was hypnotized. They could keep them right there
all night that way. After they held them all night
they'd start to slaughter at sunrise. They'd sing:
</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">We aren't doing this for meanness or for fun but
we want you for fine food,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> or something like that.
I heard the song once but I never learned it all.
I wish I had, now.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This informant was certain that the Washo did not
expect a person to die as a result of the exercise of
antelope charming. He had heard of other tribes which
believed this, and he thought it peculiar (Steward 1941:
218-220). This explanation compares favorably with
the culture element distribution lists presented by
Stewart, which reported none of the traits usually considered
as part of the shaman complex in antelope
hunting common among Basin Shoshone and Paiute.
(Stewart 1941; Steward 1941.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rabbits</span></span> (92-96).—The pursuit of the jack rabbit
appears to have been changing in its importance during
the past century. Several informants recall being
told in their youth by old men that often only the hides
were stripped from rabbits to make blankets, but that
most of the meat was discarded because other game
was plentiful. However, firearms and agriculture soon
put an end to antelope hunting, and the trans-Sierran
region, like most of the nation, suffered a steady decline
in the number of deer. All informants agree that
in their own youth trips to California after deer were
necessary because there were almost no deer east of
the Sierra. All Indians agree that the deer population
in Nevada today is far greater than it was in the early
years of this century. The decrease in antelope and
deer forced a greater dependence on the jack rabbit
as a source of food as well as fur. The communal
nature of the rabbit hunt may have made possible a
gradual transference of ritual traits from the antelope
complex to the rabbit hunt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Traditionally the Washo drove rabbits into nets, a
method common in the Basin. Stewart's notes, taken
from informants in their seventies in 1936, make no
mention of any supernatural aspect of the rabbit drive.
Evening dancing during the rabbit drive was denied.
There was, however, a special leader who directed
the hunt. In later times these men were credited with
dreaming power, as this quotation illustrates: <span class="tei tei-q">“Jack
Wallace would dream where the rabbits were and when
it was time for hunting he would send out a call.”</span> The
man mentioned was described as the last of the real
dreamers. This power made him extremely influential
among the Washo, and his descendants are considered
among the claimants for the <span class="tei tei-q">“chieftainship.”</span> There appear
to have been formalized prayers which were said
before the hunt by a man with power over rabbits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Today, rabbit hunts are invariably held on Sunday.
In the words of one informant: <span class="tei tei-q">“Nowadays anybody can
just say <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let's have a hunt this Sunday.’</span><a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
They have to
hunt on Sunday because most of the men have jobs during
the week.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The disintegration of the ritualized aspects of rabbit
driving is not complete, however, and many Washo prefer
to hunt with a certain man who lives in the Indian
colony at Carson City. While no one will openly claim
that he has supernatural power, it seems clear that
his presence is important to other Indians. His role
is that of leader or captain who superintends the order
and discipline of the line of hunters who today sweep
a wide area, armed with shotguns. D'Azevedo, who was
fortunate enough to take part in a hunt in 1955, states
that prior to the hunt this man withdrew from the
group. When he asked what the leader was doing he
met evasion, and he concluded that perhaps the man
was praying. In the period covered by the memory of
my oldest informants, dances were often staged nightly
during the rabbit drives. The dancing is invariably described
as <span class="tei tei-q">“just for fun”</span> and probably was more social
than religious, but such dancing appears to have been
part of other ceremonial or semiceremonial occasions
such as the girls' dances, first-fish ceremonies and
the pine-nut dances. It seems clear that whatever tendency
there was to shift the ritualized aspects of antelope
hunting to rabbit drives has been stemmed by a
growing dependence of the Washo on wage labor which
precludes their response to dream-inspired hunts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bear</span></span> (298, 2558-2561).—Bear hunting appears never
to have been a subsistence activity among the Washo.
Many informants stoutly deny that bear meat was ever
eaten, although bear were hunted. No Washo ever gave
a direct answer to the question of why they hunted
bear if they didn't eat the meat. Others stated that
the bear might be eaten in extreme starvation conditions
but was never eaten regularly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, almost all Washo men were able
to describe in detail the method of hunting and they
obviously enjoyed telling bear-hunting stories. The following
story told to me by one of the eldest men in
Dresslerville, who claims it was told to him by a
very old man, is consistent with the stories told by
other informants.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">There was hardly any Washo who kill bear.
But I know this much ... the man who went in
there and did it tells me ... bears have their
own home in the rocks ... a hole going in the
rocks. Go in there naked with a knife or arrow
in one hand and burning pitch in other ... light
scares him out [the bear], then other men shoot
the bear in the mouth with poison arrow [see deer
hunting for reference to poison] ... get sick for
four or five days, maybe a week. Then the man
goes back in. Hardly any Indians could do this.</span><a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>

I've heard that they cook it and eat it ... not
only here but up north. After they get the rifle
they get to killing bears around here but hardly
ever hear of dividing up the bear meat.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This last remark appears to be significant as all
informants emphasized that Indians shared food equally.
Thus a statement made voluntarily that bear meat
was not shared suggests different attitudes about bears.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another informant adds the detail that when the
bear left his lair, the companions of the man who
entered the den would block the entrance so the bear
could not return. The first man to place an arrow in
the animal could claim it and get the hide. This informant
also added at this point: <span class="tei tei-q">“It's funny that the
fella who went inside was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">just an ordinary fella</span></em> [emphasis
mine].”</span> He also insisted that after a bear was
killed the hunting party painted their faces black.
Other informants claimed not to know of this or said
such painting was done when a mink was killed but
they did not know why.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One traditional story (Dangberg) sheds a bit more
light on the bear. In this tale a group of Washo were
camped near a band of Paiute who challenged the
Washo to fight. Instead of fighting, the Washo drove a
bear from its den and killed it and thus defeated the
Paiute.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had all but given up the pursuit of information on
the bear, being convinced that my informants either
honestly did not know any more (the bear having been
relatively rare in this area for a good many years)
or were unwilling to discuss something of an extremely
sacred nature, when a chance remark suggested at
least part of the explanation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A pioneer white resident who had lived in Alpine
County, California, for ninety years casually mentioned
that every Indian man who was buried during his boyhood
was wrapped in a bearskin shroud. This, coupled
with an earlier mention of <span class="tei tei-q">“rough”</span> men having bearskins,
suggests that the killing of a bear represented
the ultimate in Washo bravery and the possession of
the skin conferred extra powers on the owner. The
rifle made such acquisitions much less hazardous and
in the late nineteenth century it had become common
for Indians to own a bearskin cloak, which became
their most prized possession and was buried with them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Stewart's element lists show no evidence of any
formalized bear cult among the Washo. However,
Smith's notes, which Stewart used, report a bear shaman
who impersonated a bear (2558). Certainly the
bear was one of the spirits who could give power to
a man destined to become a shaman. Bear shamanism
is reported only for the Fish Spring Valley Paiute by
Steward and for the Tago and Wada Northern Paiute
by Stewart. These three groups constitute the only
ones having formalized bear ceremonialism of any
sort in the Basin. The bear dance and a note about
impersonating bears (Steward 1941, pp. 266, 322) suggest
that formalized bear ceremonialism came into the
Basin from the Rocky Mountains via the Ute and Bannock.
However, Kroeber reports awe of the bear,
special euphemisms for them, and ritualized secrecy
about hunting them among the Miwok which seem more
closely related to Washo behavior. Bear impersonators
among the Battle Mountain Paiute were credited with
invulnerability in war, which is reminiscent of the use
of a bear-hide cloak by Washo <span class="tei tei-q">“rough men.”</span> Although
it is not possible to make any conclusive statement
about the role of the bear in the supernatural life of
the Washo, it seems clear that the animal is held in
special awe and esteem by modern Indians.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fishing appears to be far less subject to ritualization
among the Washo than was hunting. Here again
there may be a correspondence between the amount of
ritual and the degree of certainty involved in obtaining
the desired food. The Washo area is rated by Rostlund
as being one of the higher fish-producing areas in
North America. Certainly the many lakes, streams,
and rivers were the source of great amounts of fish
every year. Indians who could at most be described
as only middle-aged, recount the tremendous numbers
of fish which swept up the streams from Lake Tahoe
during the spawning season. While the numbers may
have varied from year to year, the large number of
fish plus the intensive fishing methods employed by
the Washo almost guarantee a large catch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, d'Azevedo reports that Northern Washo
describe some degree of ritualism connected with fishing
(d'Azevedo personal communication). Dreamers are
said to have predicted the day of the spawning run.
Dances were held and prayers said, suggesting a rather
attenuated first-fish ceremony for some of the Washo
(2618). Other Washo report <span class="tei tei-q">“big times,”</span> which included
dancing and prayer, during the spring gathering on the
lake. However, in the actual catching of fish there was
much less ritual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some fishermen carried a fishing medicine composed
of dried larvae of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ephydra hians</span></span> (Say), called
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kutsavi</span></span> by the Paiute
(Heizer 1950) and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">matsi babaša</span></span>
by the Washo. These larvae were obtained from the
Mono Lake Paiute in trade or as gifts. They were considered
good food and are still eaten by some Washo.
However, in addition they were credited with having
great powers to lure fish and were rubbed on harpoons,
hooks, and lines. Perhaps this material was considered
a fish medicine because these larvae are said to be
generated from the scales of a giant fish. This leviathan
is reported to have traveled through all the lakes
in the Sierran area looking for a lake large enough in
which to live. At Mono Lake it scraped some scales
into the water before it left to find a permanent home
in Lake Tahoe (Steward 1936). Whether the Washo share
this story with the Owens Valley Paiute, I do not know,
but Mono Lake, because of its saline water and its
lack of any fish life, is thought of with some fear and
awe. Today I get the impression that some Washo still
keep a bit of this material with their fishing gear, although
they are apt to rationalize it as a lure rather
than real medicine. It should be remembered that hook-and-line
or spear fishing accounted for a much smaller
percentage of the total annual take than did trapping,
damning, netting, or other communal methods which
entailed no ritual.

Hunting And Fishing</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A number of ritual activities cluster around hunting
and fishing. Perhaps the most important is the requirement
that women, particularly menstruating women,
avoid the hunting and fishing equipment. If a woman
touched such gear the owner would bathe it and pray
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I'm giving you a bath to wash away the bad luck.”</span>
(2354-2378).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A further restriction placed on menstruating women
was that they must not eat meat during their periods.
To do so meant bad hunting for the man who killed
the game.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The meat from the neck of a deer and the intestinal
organs were forbidden to vigorous young people.
If a man ate neck meat his aim would be bad (360-368).
Neck meat was reserved for children and the
old. In actuality it would seem that only the children
and the almost decrepit ate such meat. One of my informants
who is seventy-five, thus certainly qualifying
for old age, has never tasted either neck meat or internal
organs. To do so apparently would be an admission
of loss of vigour which no Washo oldster wishes
to make. Menstruating women today will eat meat purchased
from a butcher but refrain from eating venison
or other game taken by someone they know, for fear
of spoiling his luck. Menstrual taboos also hold today
in regard to touching firearms or fishing poles, although
at least some Washo women own fishing poles,
and in the early part of this century a woman who
lives at Carson City was reputed to be a great hunter.
In times past, certain women are reported to have
made excellent bows but not to have used them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Stewart reports dances to bring deer which none of
my informants remembered. However, even in his time
the dances were said to be <span class="tei tei-q">“mainly for pleasure,”</span> which
suggests the sacred nature of such dances has gradually
faded out of the consciousness of most modern Washo,
particularly as deer hunting has become entirely an individual
enterprise and is no longer central to Washo
subsistence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As stated earlier, there appears to have been much
less ritual involved in gathering activities, perhaps because
there was much less chance of failure than in
hunting. However, Stewart reports that sometimes
dances were held to make seeds grow (2619-2621).
Such gatherings appear to be remembered, if at all,
by living Washo only as social occasions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fall pine-nut dance was clearly part of the ritual
of the pine-nut harvest (2617, 2622). The pine nut
was central to Washo winter survival, and its production
was a matter of extreme concern. Even today the
pine-nut harvest becomes a paramount interest among
all the Washo during the last part of the summer.
Speculations as to its size, wishes for rain, and survey
trips into the pine-nut hills become common, and
according to one informant: <span class="tei tei-q">“If we have a couple of
bad years somebody will say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘We ought to have a
pine-nut dance,’</span> and then we'll have one.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following account of the pine-nut dances of the
past was given to me by a man, now almost blind, of
between seventy-five and eighty. His father claimed to
be chief of the Washo through an affinal relationship
to the famous Captain Jim, and my informant maintains
the claim, stoutly denied by all other Washo except
his relatives and admitted by them only when
they are forced to depend on his hospitality. The account
is one of a well-regulated four-day ceremony
of the first fruit. However, it will become apparent
as other information is presented that it is a highly
idealized version. It is valuable, however, because it
includes a number of sacred elements of obvious importance.

Suzie Dick, an ancient Washo woman who claims to
have reached the century mark in 1959, recalls that
Captain Jim was her mother's sister's son and that
she called him brother. He was a big man in a figurative
if not a literal sense. He wore eagle feathers on
his head and arms. He had red trousers made out of
a blanket with feathers on the sides of the legs. As
she remembers him at these ceremonies: <span class="tei tei-q">“He would
scare you to death.”</span> The assembled Washo brought
pine nuts, deer meat, megal [Indian tea], and much
other food. Captain Jim prayed and gave a sermon,
urging everyone to drink water and avoid liquor, and
supervised four nights of dancing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Judging from the age of these two informants, these
meetings, which they claim were attended by all the
Washo, were held between 1880 and 1900. Most Washo
agree that these large meetings were the way <span class="tei tei-q">“they
did it in the old days.”</span> However, <span class="tei tei-q">“the old days”</span> appear
not to be aboriginal but the late nineteenth century,
when the Washo experienced a brief period of
semi-unity and prosperity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rupert, the psychologically oriented shaman comments,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hell, them northern Washo didn't come down
to Double Springs very much. They got their pine nuts
southeast of Reno. Captain Jim he was only a big man
to them Carson Valley Washo. He didn't have nothing
to say to the northern bunch.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Despite this, it seems clear that during the last
part of the nineteenth century large numbers of Washo
from the various areas did, in fact, gather at Double
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Springs prior to the pine nutting. It seems equally
clear that this was distinctly a postwhite phenomenon
and that in aboriginal times such gatherings were
much smaller.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The essential elements of these pine-nut ceremonies
are clear. There was a gathering of a number of bands,
usually at the prompting of a dreamer who knew certain
prayers and songs which would insure a successful
harvest. There was a sharing of food among the
celebrants, as well as dancing and ceremonial bathing.
Such affairs were held in Sierra Valley and at Double
Springs and probably at a number of other places in
the pine-nut hills.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The large celebrations at Double Springs appear to
have taken on a distinctly nativistic or revitalistic
cast. Informants remember Captain Jim's exhortations
to abstain from white man's whiskey, to treat each
other as brothers and sisters, to eat Indian food, and
to apply themselves to the business of hunting and
gathering. He himself refused to wear new white clothing
but accepted only used garments. It was during
this period that Washo received individual pine-nut
allotments based on their traditional picking grounds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mooney (1896), whose information on the Washo was
filtered through the Paiute, reports the Washo during
this period as a shattered remnant of a former society
eking out an existence in the dump heaps of white settlements
in Nevada. The fact that the Washo did not
respond to the Ghost Dance seems in his mind to support
his notions about the condition of the tribe. However,
among older informants this period is invariably
recalled as an almost golden age. Although the implications
of movements such as the Ghost Dance were
not clear in Mooney's time, it seems more than likely
that the Washo failed to join the movement because
they were not suffering the social and cultural dislocation
of the Paiute, Plains tribes, or California Indians
and, in fact, may have been undergoing a process of
social unification under Captain Jim. This unification
appears to have had its primary symbolization in the
ritual activity which surrounded earlier ceremonies
concerned with pine-nut harvesting. The use of a hide
string to summon people to the meeting appears earlier
as a war signal used by a threatened band to entreat
other Washo (often not too successfully) to come
to their aid.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the death of Captain Jim, the large gatherings
at Double Springs appear to have ceased. In the words
of one informant, <span class="tei tei-q">“When he died all them things like
the knotted string and that stuff died with him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After his death the pine-nut dances continued to be
held in various places in Washo country—Sugar Loaf
Mountain, Genoa, and Sierra Valley being the most
frequently mentioned. Jim's daughter (or sister's daughter)
who was married to the claimant Captain Pete
and was the mother of the present claimant, Hank Pete,
staged a number of dances around Genoa until her death.
This action is of interest in view of the fact that she
was considered a dangerous woman and a poisoner. It
suggests that there was in fact no clear distinction between
doctors and witches or sorcerers. Her knowledge
of pine-nut prayers and songs made her essential in the
ceremony despite the fear the Washo may have had of her.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since her death in the early 1940's, pine-nut dances
have been less frequent. Only one woman among the
Washo is reputed to know all the songs, although I
suspect that several others are in possession of this
knowledge but refuse to come forth and serve as
leaders, in keeping with Washo reluctance to assume
responsible roles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After a number of years without a dance, the custom
was revived in the early 1950's at Dresslerville. The
dances were staged because previous crops had been
poor and it was felt a dance would increase the harvest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These dances, supervised by the woman who knew
the songs, were not considered too successful because
both Indian dances and white men's dances were conducted.
Indian dances were held outside the community
house while younger couples danced in the white manner
inside. The prayers, bathing, and dreams played
a very minor role, although food was supplied. From
the accounts these dances sounded extremely secular
with an emphasis on the recreational aspects, particularly
dancing. However, the consensus that the ceremonies
were not successful because of the introduction
of white-style dancing suggests that the Indian dances
still retain some of their former sacred character. It
was agreed that a dance might be held today or in the
future if the crops were poor. Here again the present
economic situation of the Washo tends to limit these
affairs to weekends. The impossibility of holding four-day
dances however, is not considered serious by most
Washo. Several informants stoutly denied that there
was any requirement that the dance last four days.
They implied that those who insisted on this were
simply trying to make it sound more important (note
that using the figure four makes something more important).
Their accounts report that the dances might
last from one or two days to a week during which
time games were played, dances held, and the ritual
described earlier carried out. However, there is no
doubt that the dances were important to the success
of the harvest and the well-being of the harvesters.
One informant recalls that: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sometimes them pine nuts
was ripe before the dance. If we picked them then
[before the dance], we took a bath every day before
we started picking but we didn't have to do that after
the dance.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following incident illustrates the attitude most
conservative Washo have toward the pinyon pine.
D'Azevedo (personal communication) accompanied an
elderly woman to her pine-nut allotment where she
discovered that illegal Christmas-tree cutters had
topped a number of trees, which she believed destroyed
their ability to bear. Her response was of
sorrow rather than anger. She sat under her trees for
a long time apologizing to her father, from whom she
had inherited the plot, and to the spirits of the trees.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There seems to have been little ritual involved in
other gathering activities, except for the dances to
make the seeds grow mentioned in the element lists
(2621). This practice must have been occasional and
relatively old, because it is no longer part of the
memories of older informants.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although modern informants do not remember taboos
dealing with hair combing and scratching during menstruation,
they do recall being warned against combing
their hair at night. <span class="tei tei-q">“My father used to say that if we
did it we'd marry out of the tribe. Mike (her husband)
used to tell the same thing to our girls but they didn't
listen and every one of them married out of the tribe.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dried body of a bat, described as having several
different kinds of hair (Lowie 1939, p. 332) was a
powerful gambling charm. Professional Indian gamblers,
who traveled about the country participating in the hand
game, often carried one. Bat power was considered extremely
dangerous if one did not know how to use it.
<span class="tei tei-q">“My daughter found a bat in a field one day, but an
old Indian said that if she didn't know how to treat it,
it would eat up her children.”</span> Women especially were
afraid of bat-talismans and of living bats. The Washo
believe that a bat charm is also a powerful love medicine
and that a woman once touched by such a charm
is powerless in the hands of its owner. <span class="tei tei-q">“You touch a
woman with that thing and it hypnotizes her. She follow
the guy and die if she don't go with him. I don't believe
I ever heard of a Washo use one. We'd be too afraid.
But them Paiutes and Shoshones use it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Except for the painting of a girl during her puberty
dance, painting of the face and body had little part in
Washo ritualism, although its social significance may
have been important (Lowie 1939, p. 304). However,
certain other customs of dress and adornment appear
to have had religious significance. Eagle feathers and
magpie feathers, as well as a bearskin robe, conferred
power. A similar notion may explain the use of the
skin of the agile and wise long-tailed weasel as a
binding for hair braids.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The hooting of an owl or singing of birds at night was
considered as a warning of danger or an omen of death.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Washo have been exposed to Christianity from
two main sources. Missionary groups have maintained
representatives from time to time at one or another
of the Washo colonies. A church dominates the appallingly
dreary landscape of Dresslerville. Weather and
neglect have caused the building to deteriorate. Permanent
missionizing efforts apparently have been
abandoned. One church group carries on a summer
Bible class for children and sewing classes for women.
Funerals are generally conducted by a Christian minister,
but this appears to be a sop to white opinion rather
than the result of any real desire on the part of
the Washo to become Christians. At best they seem
to have simply incorporated Christian services as another
source of power. It is less than surprising that
a people whose main religious emphasis seems to
have been on curing or subsistence ritual should have
found white doctors useful but white ministers a rather
mysterious and superfluous bit of white culture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other main source of Christian ideas has been
the peyote cult, which includes a roughly Christian
version of God and Christ visualized as the father and
the brother. The cross, pictures of Christ, and references
to Jesus play a role in peyote ceremonialism.
Other investigators (d'Azevedo and Merriam 1951; Stewart
1944) have noted a shift toward Indian tradition in
the Washo peyote cult, with an attending reduction of
Christian ideas. The attitude of one Washo woman
sums the question up quite well: <span class="tei tei-q">“I think them peyote
people [she was not a peyotist but had encouraged her
son to attend a meeting to cure a back injury] believe
more what they doing than the white preacher.”</span> Her
own religion is summed up in her actions. In addition
to sending her son to peyote meetings, she had taken
her granddaughter to the shaman and is a regular attendant
at the church sewing school. She was also the
person who waited until the minister left the church
to repeat ancient funeral prayers.
